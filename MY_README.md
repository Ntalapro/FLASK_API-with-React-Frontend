#Trivia App

This project is a trivia game app for Udacity students and stuff. Users are able to add and delete questions, veiw questions, search for questions from different categories, and play a quiz game. By completing this project, students learn and apply their skills structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices.

All backend code follows PEP8 style guidelines.

Getting Started
Pre-requisites and Local Development
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

Backend
From the backend folder run pip install requirements.txt. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the server application run the following commands:

export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the __init__.py file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the Flask documentation.

The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

Frontend
From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:

npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.

Tests
In order to run tests navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:

dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.

API Reference

Getting Started
Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.
Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

400: Bad Request
404: Resource Not Found
422: Not Processable
500: Internal Server Error
